# FallGuyStats-Api
The Backend API for the Fall Guy Stats App written in ASP.NET C# with EFCore.
It watches the log file as you play for a DTO output in your player.log file, captures that DTO and adds it to the SQLite db.
Has endpoints for Episodes, Rounds, and Stats.
It provides data for the [frontend project](github.com/lealeelu/FallGuyStats-FE), but can also be used with other projects independently since it's just an API.
